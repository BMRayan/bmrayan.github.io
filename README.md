I am a second-year undergraduate student at [Texas A&M University's Qatar Campus](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering. 

## On-Going Projects

### Machine Learning Models for Transformer Fault Detection
Utilizing the DGA database, I am developing machine learning models that interpret historical gas concentration data to predict transformer faults. This research aims to integrate data science with domain expertise to optimize decision-making processes in transformer maintenance and reliability.

### Publicly Accessible DGA Database for Transformers
Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a critical diagnostic tool for monitoring the health of oil-filled transformers. To support advancements in this domain, I have spearheaded the creation of a publicly available database containing data for over 1,000 samples from 900+ transformers. This database is meticulously processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and ease of use for researchers and professionals. It is a step towards democratizing access to high-quality transformer data, enabling better predictive maintenance models and fault detection.
