I am a third-year undergraduate at [Texas A&M University's Qatar Campus](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics. My current work centers on developing physically grounded 3D reconstruction methods—most notably PhysicsNeRF, a framework that integrates physics-based constraints into neural radiance fields for high-fidelity scene reconstruction from sparse visual data. This research is under review at the ICML 2025 Workshop on Building Physically Plausible World Models, part of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). I also advance machine learning and data-centric AI systems for trustworthy, secure, and scalable applications in power systems (predictive transformer fault detection), healthcare (phenomic clustering for clinical diagnostics), and scientific computing hardware, aiming to bridge fundamental research with impactful, real-world solutions.


## On-Going Projects

### PhysicsNeRF: Physics-Guided 3D Reconstruction from Sparse Views
*Short Paper, ICML 2025 (under review)*  
Developed a physics-grounded 3D reconstruction framework that integrates depth and semantic priors into Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), enabling high-fidelity scene reconstruction from minimal images and analyzing the generalization limits of sparse-view learning.

### QCRI – AI Research Intern
**Artificial Intelligence Group, Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)**  
Benchmarking state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and translating complex phenomic clustering with dynamic flow into real-world clinical settings for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) diagnosis.

### Machine Learning for Transformer Fault Detection
Building a diagnostic tool and API that leverages machine learning to analyze Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data for transformer fault prediction, improving accuracy and supporting predictive maintenance.

### Public DGA Database for Transformers – WebApp
Developed and currently expanding a user-friendly web app with a public DGA database (1,000+ samples from 900+ transformers), supporting researchers and industry with clean, structured data for predictive maintenance and monitoring.
