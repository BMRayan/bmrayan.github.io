Electrical Engineering Student | AI Researcher | Qatar

I'm a third-year undergraduate at Texas A&M University Qatar, passionate about **physics-informed deep learning** and **multimodal AI for scientific applications**. My work bridges computational science with real-world impact across oceanography, environmental monitoring, and social good initiatives.

## What I'm Working On

### PhysicsNeRF: 3D Reconstruction with Physics
Currently developing a neural radiance field framework that integrates physics-based constraints for high-quality 3D reconstruction from just a few images. This work is under review at ICML 2025 and represents my deep dive into how physics can guide AI to solve complex visual problems with limited data.

### AI for Humanitarian Applications  
Building multimodal foundation models for crisis response and displaced population support. My **EMPATHIA** project focuses on culturally-aware human-AI collaboration, while **Symbiotic Intelligence** explores how AI can enhance human expert decision-making during humanitarian crises.

### Environmental Data Science
From transformer fault detection to oceanographic research applications, I'm exploring how machine learning can solve critical infrastructure and environmental challenges. Currently interning at Qatar Computing Research Institute, benchmarking cutting-edge clustering algorithms for biomedical and scientific datasets.

## Research Focus Areas

**Physics-Informed Geometric Deep Learning**  
Developing neural networks that respect physical laws and geometric constraints, particularly for 3D reconstruction, environmental modeling, and scientific simulation.

**Foundation Models for Science**  
Building large-scale AI systems that can process diverse data types (visual, sensor, satellite) while maintaining scientific rigor and transferring knowledge across domains.

**Applied AI for Social Good**  
Creating accessible AI tools for disaster response, environmental justice, and community-based monitoring systems.

## Recent Highlights

- **Global Recognition**: 2nd place globally at Invent for the Planet competition for coastal electrification solutions
- **Research Funding**: $21,000+ in competitive grants from Qatar Foundation and research councils
- **Publications**: Multiple papers under review at top-tier conferences (ICML, NeurIPS) and accepted at CIGRE 2025
- **Industry Impact**: Developed automation tools at SLB that reduced report turnaround from days to minutes
