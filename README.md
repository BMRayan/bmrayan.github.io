I am a second-year undergraduate student at [Texas A&M University's Qatar Campus](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering with minor in Mathematics and Physics. My research interests lie in building new generations of ultra-high-performance computing hardware and developing machine learning and data-centric AI systems that are trustworthy and secure for our data, aiming to make an impact on both the scientific community and the world.

## On-Going Projects

### Machine Learning for Transformer Fault Detection
Developing a diagnostic tool and API that leverages machine learning models to analyze historical Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data for predicting transformer faults. This project enhances decision-making in transformer maintenance by improving fault detection accuracy.

### Public DGA Database for Transformers - WebApp
[Currently expanding into a user friendly Web App] Built a publicly accessible DGA database containing over 1,000 samples from 900+ transformers. The database is designed for researchers and industry professionals, providing a clean and structured dataset to support predictive maintenance and transformer monitoring.
