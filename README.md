I am a second-year undergraduate student at [Texas A&M University's Qatar Campus](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am also part of the Engineering Honors Program and serve as Vice-President of The Peace Club at our campus. My academic and extracurricular journey has been shaped by a strong passion for data analytics, machine learning, and quantum computing.

Today, with the increasing complexity and volume of data, fields like transformer condition monitoring and dissolved gas analysis (DGA) demand innovative approaches to analyze, interpret, and leverage data for practical decision-making. Inspired by these challenges, my current research focuses on developing comprehensive databases and employing machine learning models to enhance fault detection and transformer condition monitoring. My aim is to provide actionable insights for industries while promoting the accessibility and usability of these datasets.

## On-Going Projects

### Publicly Accessible DGA Database for Transformers
Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a critical diagnostic tool for monitoring the health of oil-filled transformers. To support advancements in this domain, I have spearheaded the creation of a publicly available database containing data for over 1,000 samples from 900+ transformers. This database is meticulously processed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and ease of use for researchers and professionals. It is a step towards democratizing access to high-quality transformer data, enabling better predictive maintenance models and fault detection.

### Machine Learning Models for Transformer Fault Detection
Utilizing the DGA database, I am developing machine learning models that interpret historical gas concentration data to predict transformer faults. This research aims to integrate data science with domain expertise to optimize decision-making processes in transformer maintenance and reliability.
