I am a third-year undergraduate at [Texas A&M University's Qatar Campus](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/), majoring in Electrical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Physics. My research focuses on building next-generation ultra-high-performance computing hardware and developing trustworthy, secure machine learning and data-centric AI systems to positively impact both science and society.

## On-Going Projects

### PhysicsNeRF: Physics-Guided 3D Reconstruction from Sparse Views
*Short Paper, ICML 2025 (under review)*  
Developed a physics-grounded 3D reconstruction framework that integrates depth and semantic priors into Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), enabling high-fidelity scene reconstruction from minimal images and analyzing the generalization limits of sparse-view learning.

### QCRI – AI Research Intern
**Artificial Intelligence Group, Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)**  
Benchmarking state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and translating complex phenomic clustering with dynamic flow into real-world clinical settings for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) diagnosis.

### Machine Learning for Transformer Fault Detection
Building a diagnostic tool and API that leverages machine learning to analyze Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data for transformer fault prediction, improving accuracy and supporting predictive maintenance.

### Public DGA Database for Transformers – WebApp
Developed and currently expanding a user-friendly web app with a public DGA database (1,000+ samples from 900+ transformers), supporting researchers and industry with clean, structured data for predictive maintenance and monitoring.
